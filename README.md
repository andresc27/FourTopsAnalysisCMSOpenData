# FourTopsAnalysisCMSOpenData
Simplified analysis of the production of four top quarks in a single lepton channel (electron+jets)

There are three important python notebooks

1. Electron_Analyzer.ipynb
   This notebook is used to open the whole dataset which is codificated in a .json file. Then the baseline event selection is applied.
2. Electron_plots.ipynb
   Is used to plot histogramas of all the relevant variables
3. BDT_similar.ipynb
   Is used to apply a simplified BDT algorithm
